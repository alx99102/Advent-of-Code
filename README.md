# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Each day's challenge is solved in a separate folder.

## Project Structure

- Each day of the challenge has its own folder, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01`, `ay02`, etc.).
- Inside each `dayXX` folder, you will find:
  - The solution code files.
  - The `input.txt` problem dataset I used to solve the challenges

## Instructions for Each Challenge

For detailed instructions and the problem statement of each day's challenge, navigate to the corresponding day's page on the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) site.
